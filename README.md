# Developing a Calisthenics Scoring System


## Brief Description:

For Bruin Sports Analytics Consulting during the Fall 2023 quarter, I helped create a scoring system for a calisthenics competition featuring five exercises via statistical programming in Python. The goal was to assign a weight to each exercise that would ensure that an average athlete who is equally strong on all exercises, relative to other athletes, would have the same probability of earning an equal points value (i.e., score) on any exercise. Using calisthenics data compiled over nine years, I scaled the recorded repititions completed by athletes for each exercise to establish standardized weights for each exercise such that the average score is 500 and a score of 1000 is considered exceptional.
